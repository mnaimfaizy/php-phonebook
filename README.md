## Getting Started
To get the most of this project you need to clone it or make a fork of it for yourself, since this project's files are open source and I also love to contributions.

### Prerequisites

You need to have `Apache` and `PHP` installed on your system, you can install them one by one or using a package for your operating system.

### Installing
All you need to is clone the project and run it no extra work is needed.

## Technologies used
I have used `PHP` as the server side language and for UI I have used `Bootstrap 4` with `jQuery` which gives the project a unieque look. 

There is no `MySQL` database or any other kind just `XML` files to store the data which works very well and they are secured with `htaccess` file.
